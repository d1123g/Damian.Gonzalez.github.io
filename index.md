I'm a researcher in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. My work focuses on the design and optimization of high-speed actuators driven by electrostatic forces, with applications in microsystems, soft robotics, and precision manipulation.

My research combines experimental techniques, microfabrication, and modeling to explore new approaches to fast and efficient actuation using electrostatics.
